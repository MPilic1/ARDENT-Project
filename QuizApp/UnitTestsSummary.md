## Technical Implementation Details

### Test Infrastructure
- **Framework**: xUnit 2.9.2
- **Mocking**: Moq 4.20.72
- **Database**: Entity Framework InMemory Database
- **Target Framework**: .NET 8.0

### Common Test Patterns
1. **Arrange**: Set up in-memory database, create test data, configure mocks
2. **Act**: Call the controller method being tested
3. **Assert**: Verify the expected response type and data

### Security Features Tested
- Password hashing using PBKDF2 (Rfc2898DeriveBytes)
- Password salt generation
- Password verification
- User authentication flow

### Data Validation Tested
- Model validation attributes (Required, EmailAddress, StringLength, RegularExpression)
- Business rule validation (unique usernames/emails, quiz requirements)
- Input sanitization and error handling

## Test Coverage Summary
- **Total Tests**: 27
- **Passing Tests**: 27
- **Failing Tests**: 0
- **Test Categories**: 6
- **Controllers Tested**: 3 (AuthController, QuizController, GameController)

## Key Benefits
1. **Regression Prevention**: Ensures new changes don't break existing functionality
2. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior
